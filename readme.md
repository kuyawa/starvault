**Project Title:** StarVault

**Summary:** Unplugged mobile vault for Stellar

**Category:** Applications

**Goals:** 

- Protect your Stellar investment
- Secure offline transaction signing
- QR code communication only, totally unplugged

Timeline:

- APR 2020: Unplugged app
- MAY 2020: Public app

**Description:** 

StarVault is an unplugged mobile app used as a vault for your Stellar stash. Installed in an old phone without internet connection it will allow you to create transactions and transmit them as QR codes so a live app can send them to the network, making expensive hardware wallets obsolete and keeping your lumens safe and secure.

StartVault has two apps, one for editing transactions on a live phone and one for signing transactions on an unplugged phone. They both talk to each other using qrcodes. Once the transaction has been signed off-line it will be presented to the public phone as a qrcode for transmission to the Stellar network. The private key is never shared, period.

StarVault is unplugged, unhackable, unbreakable and impossible to penetrate from external sources, making it the most secure crypto vault in the whole world. It's easier to hack your fridge or your toaster than your StarVault since it's not connected to anything.

Stop wasting hundreds of dollars on hardware wallets that are a pain to use and can fail miserably leaving you with thousands more in losses and a constant worry about bad actors stealing your investments. Invest safely, use StarVault.
